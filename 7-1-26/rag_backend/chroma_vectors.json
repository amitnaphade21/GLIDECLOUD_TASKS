    "chunk_text": "At GlideCloud, the leave policy is designed to balance employee flexibility with operational continuity while remaining simple and transparent for all team members. During the initial probation or contract period of the first six months, employees are granted a total of six paid leaves, which effectively means an average of one leave per month, and these leaves must be used thoughtfully as unused leaves do not automatically carry forward to the next period. During this six-month period, GlideCloud strictly follows the sandwich leave policy, which means that if an employee takes leave on days that are immediately before and after a weekend or an official company holiday, then the intervening weekend or holiday is also counted as part of the leave period; for example, if an employee takes leave on a Friday and the following Monday, then Saturday and Sunday will also be counted as leave days, making it a total of four leave days instead of two. The purpose of the sandwich policy is to discourage the practice of extending holidays by combining casual leaves with weekends or public holidays while still allowing genuine leave usage for personal or medical reasons. Once an employee successfully completes the six-month period and is converted to a full-time employee, the leave structure changes significantly, and they become eligible for a total of twenty-five paid leaves per year, which includes fifteen casual leaves and ten sick leaves, with sick leaves intended strictly for health-related issues and casual leaves for personal or planned time off. Even after full-time conversion, GlideCloud may continue to apply the sandwich policy in situations where leave is taken immediately before and after weekends or declared holidays, and all employees are expected to plan their leaves in advance, inform their managers, and ensure proper handover of responsibilities to avoid disruption to business operations.",
