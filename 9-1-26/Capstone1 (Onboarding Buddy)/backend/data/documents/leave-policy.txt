GlideCloud Leave Policy

This document describes the official leave policy of GlideCloud Technologies and applies to all full-time, probationary, and contractual employees unless explicitly stated otherwise.

1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that employees take adequate rest while also maintaining business continuity. Leave is provided to employees to attend to personal matters, illness, family responsibilities, and other important commitments.

2. Applicability

This policy applies to all employees of GlideCloud including those on probation, full-time employees, and confirmed staff members.

3. Leave During Probation Period

During the probation period, which is the first six months of employment, employees are entitled to a total of six (6) paid leaves. These leaves may be used for personal or medical reasons. Unused leaves during probation will not be carried forward after confirmation.

4. Leave After Confirmation

After successful completion of the probation period, employees will be entitled to the following annual leave benefits:
- 15 Casual Leaves (CL)
- 10 Sick Leaves (SL)

These leaves are credited at the beginning of each calendar year or on a prorated basis if the employee joins mid-year.

5. Sandwich Leave Policy

GlideCloud follows a sandwich leave policy. If an employee takes leave on a working day that is immediately before and after a weekend or public holiday, then the weekend or holiday in between will also be counted as leave.

For example, if an employee takes leave on Friday and the following Monday, then Saturday and Sunday will also be counted as leave days.

6. Sick Leave

Sick leave should be used only in case of illness or medical emergencies. If an employee is absent for more than two consecutive days, the company may request a medical certificate.

7. Casual Leave

Casual leave can be used for personal work, family functions, or short-term personal matters. Casual leave should be applied at least one day in advance unless there is an emergency.

8. Carry Forward and Encashment

Sick leave may be carried forward up to a maximum of 20 days. Casual leave cannot be carried forward. Unused casual leave will lapse at the end of the calendar year. Currently, GlideCloud does not offer leave encashment.

9. Leave Application Process

All leave requests must be applied through the company HR management system or communicated to the reporting manager via email in case of emergencies. Approval from the reporting manager is mandatory.

10. Unauthorized Absence

Unauthorized absence for more than three consecutive days may be treated as misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action.

11. Holidays

Declared company holidays are not counted as leave unless covered under the sandwich policy.

12. Amendments

GlideCloud reserves the right to amend or modify this policy at any time without prior notice.
